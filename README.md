## Yet another roguelike game

A project in the course INF3331 at UiO, fall 2011. Made by martinhb(Elvorn) and daniehol.

The code was produced in a week, and some of it might be ugly and inefficient.

Icons/graphics from http://opengameart.org/ and http://rltiles.sourceforge.net/

Developed using Python version 2.7.
